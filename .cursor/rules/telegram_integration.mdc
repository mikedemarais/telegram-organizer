## Telegram Implementation Rules
- Use `InputPeer` and `GetHistory` API calls for silent monitoring
- Handle PEER_ID_INVALID errors gracefully (see @file:src/telegram.rs startLine:160 endLine:172)
- Implement 2-second delays between member info requests to avoid rate limits
- Follow chat participant parsing pattern from @file:src/telegram.rs startLine:234 endLine:259
