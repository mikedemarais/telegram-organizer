## Security Requirements
- NEVER commit API credentials (TG_ID/TG_HASH) - keep in .env
- All database operations must use transactions for data integrity
- Maintain silent monitoring: No read receipts in Telegram API calls
- Sensitive files (.env, *.session, *.db) must be excluded via .gitignore
- Reference: @file .gitignore (lines 13,16,20)
